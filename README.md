# social_cause_infant_mortality
This repository focuses on analyzing and predicting infant mortality rates. The goal is to uncover significant patterns and identify key factors that influence infant mortality across different regions and demographics. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, aim to create predictive models that can help inform policies aimed at reducing infant mortality.
Data Collection: Gathered datasets related to infant mortality, including health, socio-economic, and environmental factors. The data was sourced from government health statistics, UNICEF, and World Bank.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Inspected the data for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. Handled missing data through imputation or removal, normalized/scaled numerical features, and encoded categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to understand the relationships between variables. Identified correlations between features and explored how they influenced infant mortality.
Feature Selection: Used statistical tests (e.g., correlation, chi-squared test) to select significant features contributing to infant mortality prediction.
Model Building: Trained machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) on the preprocessed data to predict infant mortality rates.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC. Fine-tuned hyperparameters for better performance.
Interpretation & Conclusion: Analyzed the results, identified key risk factors, and suggested interventions to reduce infant mortality.
